ii. On the other end of rods k are arms Z Z,
so that when the log is sawed up the nuts or
screws G G come in contact with arms Z Z,
and, movivg the rods K K and the arms v v,
disconnect the pinions i i from plates b b and
stops setting. The double-acting lever D,
Figs. 4 4, is made fast to the top of shaft m,
which works in bearings attached to frame
A. The lower end of shaft m is made fast to
plate t with notch n, to receive the latch g,
connected to the angle lever u. The anglo-
lever u swings on shaft m, and is connected
with link l'. The latch q, being raised ont of
notch n-and moved around, shifts the belts x
and y and stops the motion of the carriage B
without changing the position of double-acting
lever D.
  Having thus described the construction and
operation of our invention, what we claimn as
new, and desire to secure. by Latters Patent,
isâ€”
  L. Changing the saw after each cut alter-
nately from an oblique position in one direc-
tion to an oblique position in a contrary direc-
tion to the line of the log-carriage Whlle cut-
ting in either direction by the movements of

the machine, and for the purposes herein set
forth.
  2. The gwing-guides W' W', in combination
with the stationary guides W W, for the pur-
pose of guiding the saw, as described.
  3. The two wedge-rollers or wedges P' and
P'', to keep the board clear of the saw while
cutting in either direction, as described.
  4. The combination of pinions i and their
pins o, entering into recesses of plates b, the
ratchet-wheels g, the ratchets r, the adjusta-
ble segments J, the wheels G', the screws G,
and the rods K with their clutches z and v,
for the purpose ' of setting the log to the saw
and stopping tho setting when the log-frame
advances too close to the saw.
  5. The notched plate t,in combination with
the latch g, lever u, and link l, for the pur-
pose of operating the belt-shifter l without
turning the lever D, substantially as set forth.
