# ML4Science project - Patent digitization
The aim of this project is to explore digitization solutions for patents.
## Scope
The corpus we are working with is a corpus of X US and UK patents from YYYY to YYYY. This corpus is a sample of a larger corpus of patents sharing the same caracteristics.
Those patents are in pdf files or in a collection of tif files. In the current state, they are not machine-readable. The goal of this project is to explore possible solutions to make them machine-readable.
## File structure
The UK patents are in PDF format which contain TIF files (content in stream
objects, format in "filter" header: CCITTFaxDecode).
The US patents are in TIF files and an XML.
## Run the project
